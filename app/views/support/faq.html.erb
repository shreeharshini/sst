                  	COUNTER (Counting Online Usage of NeTworked Electronic Resources) is an initiative formed by libraries and publishers to insure consistent usage in reporting. COUNTER also requires specific reports and definition of usage terms for COUNTER compliance. The COUNTER Codes of Practice provides a set of standards and protocols governing the recording and exchange of online usage data. To learn more about COUNTER, visit www.projectcounter.org.
